# Astarte Cluster GitHub Action

[![](https://github.com/drf/astarte-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/drf/astarte-action/actions)

A GitHub Action that creates a local [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) cluster for testing application against it.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

This action creates a local Kubernetes environment using [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) through the @container-tools/kind-action GitHub Action.
As such, when using this action, the runner must be running Linux and a Kubernetes environment will be created and owned by the Astarte Cluster.

Create a workflow YAML file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below.
For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

- `astarte_chart_version`: The Helm chart version for Astarte Operator. Defaults to the last one in the 1.x series.
- `astarte_version`: The Astarte version to install. This will match both the Operator and the Astarte version. Defaults to `1.0.1`.
- `astarte_realm`: The Astarte Realm that will be created with the cluster. Defaults to `test`.
- `astarte_namespace`: The Kubernetes namespace where Astarte will be installed. Defaults to `astarte`.
- `kind_version`: The kind version to use (default: `v0.11.1`). Advised to leave as default.
- `kind_node_image`: The Docker image for the cluster nodes. Advised to leave as default.

### Outputs

- `housekeeping_key`: The Housekeeping private key for the newly created Astarte Cluster.
- `realm_key`: The Realm private key.

Moreover, after running the action, [`astartectl`](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astartectl) will be in your `$PATH`,
already configured for the Cluster and the Realm. If you need to interact with the cluster to e.g. register a device,
the simplest and advised way is to simply use `astartectl`.

### Example Workflow

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/create-cluster.yml`):

```yaml
name: Create Astarte Cluster

on: pull_request

jobs:
  create-cluster:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create Astarte Cluster
        uses: astarte-platform/astarte-action@v1
```

This uses [@astarte-platform/astarte-action](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-action) GitHub Action to spin up an [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) Kubernetes cluster on every Pull Request.

The action also sets up [astartectl](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astartectl) with a context already configured to operate on the new Cluster and
Realm. As such, you can immediately use commands such as `astartectl pairing agent register` to set up your own devices for testing.

API Tokens can ben generated using `astartectl utils gen-jwt`.
